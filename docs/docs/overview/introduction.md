# Introduction

Novu is an open-source notification infrastructure, built for engineering teams to help them build rich product notification experiences without constantly reinventing the wheel.

## Why?

Developing a notification layer is something we often do when designing a new application. It usually starts the same, sending an email here, a push notification there but before you know it, you have to manage hundreds of notifications across different channels.

Novu’s goal is to help developers create meaningful and transactional communication between the product and its users. All with an easy-to-use API and outstanding developer experience.

## Unified API

Today, users tend to receive communication from multiple providers: [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/) for Email, [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) for SMS, Mailchimp, Push, Web-Push, and Chat messaging (Slack, etc...). The main reason behind this is that users expect to customize the communication channels to fit their needs and goals. This forces developers to manage all of those APIs across the codebase.

As developers, we tend to create abstractions. However with growing number of integrations, channels of communication that are sent become a burden on the team and are usually implemented hastily in a "just-make-it-work" mode.

Novu provides a single API to manage all your customer communication. With Novu, managing your customer communication is now easier than ever. Our powerful API allows you to seamlessly integrate multiple communication providers and switch between them effortlessly.

So, whether your email provider is experiencing downtime or there's some other issues, you won't have to worry about losing contact with your customers. With Novu, you can focus on delivering the best experience to your customers, and leave the communication logistics to us.

We'll make sure you're covered. Pinky promise!

## Community Driven

When we just started, we felt the frustration of reinventing the wheel of notification infrastructure and thought that it was a unique problem that not a lot of developers had experienced.

After a couple of conversations with fellow engineers, we decided to open-source the initial seed of Novu. And boy, were we wrong!

The seed exploded and thousands of developers from around the world started reaching out to tell us their stories of building such systems in-house.

It was then that we realized: Building Novu was not going to be an act of an individual alone. Rather it was going to be a collaborative work of many.

That's why we invite you to join us in building the future of notification experiences. Let's work together to create a better way to keep users informed and engaged.
